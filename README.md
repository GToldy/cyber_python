#Project Idea: Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software or hardware solution that monitors network traffic for suspicious activities or known attack patterns. It helps identify potential security breaches and alerts system administrators for further investigation. For this project, you can develop a basic IDS using Python. Here's a breakdown of the project:

Week 1: Design and Setup

Define the scope and objectives of your IDS.
Research and identify the network protocols and attack patterns you want to detect (e.g., port scanning, brute-force attacks, SQL injection, etc.).
Design the architecture of your IDS, including components like packet capture, traffic analysis, rule matching, and alerting.
Set up the development environment, including installing required libraries and tools (e.g., scapy for packet manipulation and PyQt for GUI development).
Week 2: Packet Capture and Analysis

Implement packet capture functionality using scapy to capture network packets in real-time.
Analyze captured packets to extract relevant information such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols used, packet payloads, etc.
Implement traffic analysis algorithms to identify suspicious patterns or known attack signatures.
Start generating basic alerts for detected suspicious activities.
Week 3: Rule Matching and Alerting

Create a set of rules or signatures based on known attack patterns.
Implement a rule matching engine to compare captured traffic against the defined rules.
Enhance the alerting mechanism to generate more detailed and informative alerts when an attack is detected.
Design a simple user interface to display alerts and provide options for further investigation or response.
Week 4: Testing and Refinement

Test the IDS with simulated attacks and real-world network traffic.
Fine-tune the IDS to reduce false positives and false negatives.
Document your project, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any challenges faced during development.
Prepare a presentation or demo showcasing the features and capabilities of your IDS.
Remember, this project is just a starting point, and you can customize and extend it based on your team's interests and skill level. Make sure to prioritize proper documentation, testing, and collaboration within your team to ensure a successful project outcome.
