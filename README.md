# This is a Face attendance site Python project using face recognition

Face recognition is a technology that enables computers to identify and verify individuals based on their facial features. It has gained significant attention and applications in recent years due to its wide range of uses, including security systems, access control, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library for computer vision tasks, including face recognition. It provides various functions and algorithms that make it relatively straightforward to develop a face recognition system in Python.
